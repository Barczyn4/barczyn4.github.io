                        My name is Cody Barczynski, I was born and raised in Milwaukee Wisconsin.
                        I recently graduated from college at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
                        I now have a Bachelors of Business Administration in Information Technology Management.
                        Completing college is something that I am very proud of myself for accomplishing.
                        College has taught me about who I am, and what I value the most in life. 
                        It has also made me realize that opportunities are not going to just fall in my lap, 
                        and I must strive to go after what I want in life. In life there are going to be successes
                        and failures, but the most important thing is how we respond to and learn from these events.
                    </p>

                <h4>
                    Goals:
                </h4>
                <div class="indent">
                    <p>
                        Ideally I like to find a job as a front end web developer, creating website and adding interactive 
                        things to them is very exciting to me. I’d like to be in this field because it allows me to express myself 
                        as well as being bold and coming up with new ideas. 
                    </p>

                <div class="indent">
                    <p>
                        In personal life, i’d like to have more of a positive impact on the people in my life, all of my friends inspire me,
                        through their actions, to become the best person I can be. Watching the people in my life grow and change has been an exciting experience.
                        I’d also like to get out of my comfort zone more, trying new things and traveling.
                        Life is short and it feels like it moves faster every year. So it’s best to try and do those things now before it runs out.
                    </p>

                <h4>
                    Passion:
                </h4>

                    <p>
                        One of my greatest passions is making people laugh and feel comfortable. When I was younger I always enjoyed making people laugh. 
                        I’ve learned that laughter is one of the best ways to get to know someone. Laughter has the amazing ability to open people up and it can
                        brighten up both of your days and make you feel good, even in those days when it feels like everything isn’t going your way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another passion I have is baking/cooking; the process of taking ingredients and combining them to make something fulfilling and delicious is very relaxing to me.
                        There are rules you should follow, but something you can adapt to what your feeling, i feel like this lets you become a more creative person, it's fun to take risks
                        on something you have never tried before.
