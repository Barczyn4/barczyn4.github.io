                    <p>
                        My name is Cody, I was born and raised in Milwaukee Wisconsin.
                        I recently graduated from college at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
                        I now have a Bachelors of Business Administration in Information Technology Management.
                        Completing college is something that I am very proud of myself for accomplishing. 
                        College has taught me about who I am, and what I value the most in life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Completing college has made me realize that opportunities in work and personal life are not going to just fall in my lap.
                        I must strive to go after the things I want in life. I’m ready to take this journey and know there will be successes and failures.
                        The most important thing is how I will grow as a professional and learn from these challenges.
                    </p>

                <h4>
                    Goals:
                </h4>
                <div class="indent">
                    <p>
                        I learned in life that Goals are important to have. Goals give you a vision, and motivation for anything you would like to accomplish. Writing down goals is an important process for me, it lets me know what I need to do, and It gives me a plan for the future. This gives me something concrete to start to move towards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my career, I would like to build successful relationships with coworkers and clients. I would like to improve my communication skills. I feel this is the most important skill in life to possess. I want to constantly learn, improve and grow my professional skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my personal life, I would like to make a difference in people’s lives through volunteer work. I have always wanted to coach basketball for younger children, teaching them the importance of teamwork, having a passion to grow and improve, and most importantly having fun. I want to make sure my parents are taken care of and live can live a more comfortable life. Some longer term goals I have are wanting to travel to France, Italy, and Germany. Learning a new language, like French. Sometime in the future I would also like to get married, be a supporting husband, raise a family and own a house.
                    </p>

                <h4>
                    Passion:

                    <p>
                        One of my greatest passions is making people laugh and feel comfortable. When I was younger I always enjoyed making people laugh. 
                        I’ve learned that laughter is one of the best ways to get to know someone. Laughter has the amazing ability to open people up and it can
                        brighten up both of your days and make you feel good, even in those days when it feels like everything isn’t going your way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another passion I have is baking/cooking; the process of taking ingredients and combining them to make something fulfilling and delicious is very relaxing to me.
                        There are rules you should follow, but something you can adapt to what your feeling, i feel like this lets you become a more creative person, it's fun to take risks
                        on something you have never tried before.
